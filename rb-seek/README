rb-seek 0.1

DESCRIPTION
	rb-seek is a Rhythmbox plugin for seek backward and forward in current 
	playing tack. It adds two entries in toolbar and menu "Control":
	* Seek backward (shortcut: Control+Left)
	* Seek forward (shortcut: Control+Right)

INSTALLATION
	Copy the folder "rb-seek" into "~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins/".
	If folder "plugins" is missing, just create it.
	Alternatively copying the folder "rb-seek" to "/usr/lib/rhythmbox/plugins"
	should work, too.

SETTINGS
	Default time for seeking backward/forward is 10 seconds. If you want
	a different value, please open rb-seek.py in your installed plugins folder
	and search for
		self.seekTime = 10 # seek time in seconds. Adjust to your needs.
	Set your desired seek time. Save the file. Restart Rhythmbox. Done.
	
DEPENDENCIES
	This plugin was tested and developed within Rhythmbox 0.12.8 under 
	Ubuntu 10.04 only. But should also work with other versions.

KNOWN ISSUES
	Rhythmbox seems not reply always the correct answer if the playing 
	source is seekable. E.g. the tested MP3 streams failed to seek although
	they were announced as seekable by Rhythmbox.

LICENSE
	rb-seek is dual licensed. 
	You can choose yourself (which is important if you want to reuse the code):
	* GPL 2: Needed as Rhythmbox is also GPLed.
	* Apache License 2.0: In order for easy reuse of this code. 
	  Feel free to use it where and how you want.
